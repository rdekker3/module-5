# module-5

All code by Ryan Dekker; Used pandas to merge and create dataframes. Included the required data visulaizations using PyPlot, including bar, pie, box, and scatterplot. 

When analyzing the data and the visualizations, trends do become apparent:
 
In this experiemnt, the 12 different drug treatments were applied at a somewhat equal rate. Only Capomulin and Ramicane were used noticably more than the other ten, and Propriva was the only drug regimine used noticably less than all others. 

This sample of mice was well-controlled using an approximately equal split in gender, with 51% male, 49% female. Unsurprisingly, bigger mice and bigger tumors, with a Pearson's r correlation at r = 0.84.

The data visualization show a noticable decrease in tumor volume after this drug treatment. I included a randomly selected mouse where the tumor shrunk after the days of different measurements.
